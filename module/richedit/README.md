# [Rich Editor] Project Forge Module

This directory contains the files used by the "richedit" module of [Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev).

## Purpose

Provides an in-browser editor for JSON data with progressive enhancement.
It renders a table UI when JavaScript is enabled and falls back to raw JSON editing when it is not.

## Usage

When the "richedit" module is enabled in your project, all of the files in this directory (except this readme) will be processed and included in your application.

See [doc/module/richedit.md](doc/module/richedit.md) for usage information.
