    <p>
      <a href="https://projectforge.dev">Project Forge</a> is a powerful application generator and project manager for building modern web applications in Go.
      It empowers developers to rapidly create, customize, and scale applications through a modular architecture that puts you in complete control.
      Choose from dozens of optional modulesâ€”from database integrations and OAuth providers to advanced features like GraphQL APIs, WebSocket support, and desktop app builds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every Project Forge application includes a blazingly fast HTTP server built on <a href="https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate">quicktemplate</a> for type-safe HTML rendering.
      The optional Model-View-Controller framework provides enterprise-grade features out of the box: content negotiation, hierarchical navigation, breadcrumbs, OAuth integration with 40+ providers, stateless sessions, comprehensive theming with dark mode, SVG icon management, syntax highlighting, rich form components, and optimized asset embedding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The included UI framework delivers exceptional performance without sacrificing developer experience or user accessibility.
      This very page demonstrates the power: fully animated, themed, and responsive design delivered in just three HTTP requests (HTML, CSS, JS) totaling under 20KB compressed.
      Sub-millisecond server response times and sub-20ms browser rendering create an incredibly snappy user experience.
      Progressive enhancement via an integrated ESBuild TypeScript pipeline ensures full functionality even with JavaScript disabled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deploy anywhere, run everywhere. Project Forge applications can target virtually every platform: native desktop apps via system webviews, mobile applications for iOS and Android, WebAssembly modules, and notarized universal macOS binaries.
      Enable all build targets and generate nearly 60 platform-specific builds, each producing a compact ~20MB self-contained binary.
      Built-in auto-update capabilities work seamlessly with GitHub Releases, while comprehensive CI/CD workflows handle building, testing, linting, and publishing to multiple distribution channels.
