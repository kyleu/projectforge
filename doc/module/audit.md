# Audit

The **`audit`** module provides a comprehensive audit framework for [Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev) applications. It enables detailed tracking of user actions, data changes, and system events with minimal performance overhead.

## Overview

This module provides enterprise-grade audit logging capabilities that integrate seamlessly with your application's existing data models and workflows.

**Key Features:**
- **Change Tracking**: Automatic diff generation for object modifications
- **Action Logging**: High-level user action tracking with metadata
- **Performance Optimized**: Asynchronous logging with minimal latency impact
- **Flexible Storage**: Works with any database supported by the `database` module
- **Web Interface**: Built-in admin interface for viewing and managing audit logs

## Core Components

### Audit Records
- **Audit**: High-level action tracking (app, action, client, server, user, metadata, timing)
- **Record**: Detailed change tracking (object type, primary key, field diffs, metadata)

### Service Layer
- **Transactional Support**: Atomic audit log creation with rollback capabilities
- **Automatic Diffing**: `ApplyObjSimple()` for hands-off object change tracking
- **Custom Records**: `Apply()` for manual audit record creation

### Web Interface
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete CRUD operations via `/admin/audit` routes
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering by user, action, timeframe, and object type
- **Detailed Views**: Drill-down from high-level audits to specific field changes
