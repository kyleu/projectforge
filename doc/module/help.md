# Help

The **`help`** module provides integrated contextual help for [Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev) applications. It enables developers to embed Markdown-based documentation directly into their applications, with automatic help links and modal displays. When available for a page, a help icon will be included in the UI, no JavaScript required.

## Overview

This module provides:

- **Contextual Help**: Automatic help links based on controller action keys
- **Markdown Integration**: Rich HTML rendering of Markdown documentation
- **Modal Display**: Non-intrusive help content in overlay modals
- **Customizable Content**: Support for headers, footers, and per-page content
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with or without JavaScript

## Key Features

### Automatic Help Links
- Help links automatically appear in navigation when corresponding help files exist
- Links are keyed to controller action names for contextual relevance
- Modal display keeps users in context while providing assistance

### Markdown Processing
- Full Markdown syntax support with HTML rendering
- Automatic title extraction from first header
- Fallback to page title when no header is present
- Support for embedded images, links, and formatting

### Flexible Content Organization
- Per-page help files matched to controller keys
- Global header and footer content via `_header.md` and `_footer.md`
- Template-based generation with project data interpolation

## Usage

### Controller Integration

Each controller action can automatically display help by matching the action key to a help file:

```go
func HomeAction(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    controller.Act("home", w, r, func(as *app.State, ps *cutil.PageState) (string, error) {
        // If help/home.md exists, a help link will appear in navigation
        return controller.Render(r, as, page, ps)
    })
}
```

In this case, it would attempt to read `help/home.md` and show an icon in the header of the UI.

### Help File Structure

Help files are organized in the `help/` directory:

```
help/
├── home.md         # Help for "home" action key
├── about.md        # Help for "about" action key
├── _header.md      # Optional global header content
└── _footer.md      # Optional global footer content
```

### Content Templates

Help files support Go template syntax with project data:

```markdown
# Welcome to Project Forge

This application was generated by Project Forge and includes...
```

### Conditional Generation

Files prefixed with `!` in the header are disabled by default:

```markdown
# !About Page

Remove the `!` prefix to enable this help file.
```

## Best Practices

### Help Content Organization
- Use descriptive, action-oriented help file names
- Keep help content focused and concise
- Include examples and common use cases
- Provide links to more detailed documentation when appropriate

### Markdown Guidelines
- Use clear hierarchical headers (H1, H2, H3)
- Include code examples in fenced blocks
- Use lists and tables for structured information
- Add images sparingly and optimize for quick loading

### User Experience
- Write help content from the user's perspective
- Focus on completing tasks rather than describing features
- Use consistent terminology throughout the application
- Test help content with actual users when possible
