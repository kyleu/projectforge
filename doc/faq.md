## What is Project Forge?<a name="faq-1"></a>

[Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev) helps you build and maintain feature-rich applications written in the Go programming language.

It's a code-generation platform that uses modules, which are self-contained features for your app.
All managed projects expose a web and CLI interface, and additional modules are available for everything from OAuth to database access.

## What git actions are available?<a name="faq-6"></a>

Common git actions like `status`, `fetch`, `pull` and `commit` do exactly what you'd expect.
There's also a `magic` action, which is a little crazy:
- If there are uncommitted changes, it will stash them
- If there are pending upstream commits, it will pull them
- If a stash was previously created, it will pop and commit it
- If commits exist that haven't been pushed, it will push them


## How do I make a new HTTP action?<a name="faq-7"></a>

Create a new file in `app/controller` or a child directory, then add your method.
The usual form is:

```go
func CurrentTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	Act("current.time", w, r, func(as *app.State, ps *cutil.PageState) (string, error) {
    t := util.TimeCurrent()
    ps.SetTitleAndData("The current server time for " + util.AppName, t)
		return Render(r, as, &views.CurrentTime{Time: t}, ps, "time")
	})
}
```

Add your action to `./app/controller/routes/routes.go` like so:

```go
makeRoute(r, http.MethodGet, "/time", controller.CurrentTime)
```

Then create a menu item in `./app/controller/cmenu/menu.go` like so:

```go
i := &menu.Item{Key: "time", Title: "Current Time", Description: "...", Icon: "star", Route: "/time"}
ret = append(ret, i)
```

Templates are written in [quicktemplate](https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate), and generally take this form:

```html
{% code type CurrentTime struct {
  layout.Basic
  Time time.Time
} %}

{% func (p *CurrentTime) Body(as *app.State, ps *cutil.PageState) %}
  <div class="card">
    <h3>{%= components.SVGIcon(`calendar`, ps) %} The Current Time!</h3>
    <p>{%s fmt.Sprint(p.Time) %}</p>
  </div>
{% endfunc %}
```

The `layout.Basic` renders menu and navigation, and is swappable for custom response types.


## What is provided in the TypeScript application?<a name="faq-8"></a>

The TypeScript project (available at `./client`) is dependency-free, lightweight, and is built with ESBuild.
Most code is wired in automatically when the build's `.js` output is requested.
See the code in `./client/src` for details.

CSS is also built by ESBuild, see `./client/src/client.css` and the files in `./client/src/style`.


## How do I use custom modules?<a name="faq-9"></a>

If you want to make your own module, you can load it in Project Forge by adding the following section to the "info" object in `./.projectforge/project.json`:

```json
{
  "moduleDefs": [
    {
      "key": "foo",
      "path": "./module_foo",
      "url": "https://github.com/me/foo"
    },
    {
      "key": "*",
      "path": "../modules",
      "url": "https://github.com/me/modules"
    }
  ]
}
```


## How do I manage more than one Project Forge project at once?<a name="faq-10"></a>

Create the file `./projectforge/additional-projects.json`, containing a JSON array of string paths to other projects.


## How are static assets served?<a name="faq-11"></a>

Assets are embedded into the servier binary at build time using Go's `embed` package.
This brings a lot of advantages, but you'll need to rebuild before you see changes to your assets.
The script `./bin/dev.sh` handles the rebuild/restart automatically.


## How do I work with SVG icons?<a name="faq-12"></a>

To see available icons, click the `SVG` button on your project's page.
To add a new icon, enter the name of the icon from [Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) or paste a URL.
When added, the icon is rewritten to support themes/styling and references.

To reference an icon, add `{%= components.SVG("star") %}` in your template.
Other helper methods available, see `./views/compnents/SVG.html`


## What information is available for my projects?<a name="faq-13"></a>

So much. Open your project in the UI and explore.


## What administrative functions are available?<a name="faq-14"></a>

Assuming you've got access, going to `/admin` will show you the available actions:

- CPU/memory profiling and visualization, runtime heap dumps
- Garbage collection management and metrics
- View your projects Go modules, internal and external
- Theme management, with theme catalogs and live preview
- Lots of HTTP tools, for investigating sessions or request


## How can I secure my application?<a name="faq-15"></a>

TODO


## What options are available for the HTML menu and breadcrumbs?<a name="faq-16"></a>

TODO


## What search facilities are available?<a name="faq-17"></a>

TODO


## What utility methods are available for my app?<a name="faq-18"></a>

_So many_. See the files in `./app/util`, there's a ton of juicy stuff.


## How do I add a new model to the "export" facilities?<a name="faq-19"></a>

Export configuration is stored in `./.projectforge/export`.
A rudimentary UI is provided in the "Export" section of your project's page.
To be honest, the easiest way to do this is to copy/paste and modify an existing model definition.
There's some good examples at [rituals.dev](https://github.com/kyleu/rituals/tree/main/.projectforge/export/models).
